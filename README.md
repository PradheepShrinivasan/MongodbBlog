# MongodbBlog

The [Mongo univeristy course](https://university.mongodb.com/)  a blog tempalte was provided and students needed to complete the blog backend as part of assignment. 

I wanted to explore hosting on [heroku](heroku.com) and the [mongolab](https://mongolab.com/) as the database service and this repositary contains changes that was done and deployed to heoku and mongodb as backend.

The hosted blog can be found over heroku [here](http://fathomless-brushlands-8051.herokuapp.com/)
