# MongodbBlog

In [Mongo univeristy course](https://university.mongodb.com/)  a blog tempalte was provided and students needed to complete the blog backend as part of assignment. 

I wanted to explore hosting on [heroku](heroku.com) and the [mongolab](https://mongolab.com/) as the database service and this repositary contains changes that was done and deployed to heoku and mongodb as backend.

Details of how this was done is explained in blog posts [1](http://pradheepshrinivasan.github.io/python/mongodb/2015/10/10/Deploying_app_to_heroku%20_with_mongodb/) [2](http://pradheepshrinivasan.github.io/python/mongodb/2015/10/14/Deploying_app_to_heroku%20_with_mongodb/)

I have hosted the blog on [heroku](https://infinite-shore-9738.herokuapp.com) and you can signup for your own account [here](https://infinite-shore-9738.herokuapp.com/signup).
